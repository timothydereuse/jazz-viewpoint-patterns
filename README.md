# Computational Methods applied to Motivic Analyses of Jazz Improvisation

## Timothy de Reuse, Jonathan Orland

This is the repository containing the code for our poster presentation at [COBS 2022](http://www.ccob-cobs.org/2022/). Our poster is included.

Not all of our dataset could be made public, so we only supply two transcriptions of Charlie Parker in the `Transcriptions` folder. The rest of the code can be used to partially reproduce our results.

## Abstract

This project uses computational methods to compare the use of repeated patterns or “licks” in the improvisations of two jazz alto saxophonists, Charlie Parker and Lee Konitz. Konitz was greatly influenced by Parker but developed a highly individual style, expressing in interview that since the early stages of his career he had had no intention of adopting Parker’s “compositional approach,” deliberately avoiding Parker’s use of “formulas.” Using pattern discovery algorithms, we can automate the time-consuming process of motivic analysis and make quantifiable statements about how each performer uses repeated musical material, empirically evaluating Konitz’s statements on his and Parker’s improvisational practices. Musical pattern discovery is notoriously difficult to encode algorithmically, due to the complexity of defining what constitutes an analytically interesting musical pattern and segmenting melodic lines to find appropriate boundaries for motif occurrences. We designed an algorithm to find rhythmically complex licks in jazz saxophone solos through continuous modification based on the feedback of a jazz saxophonist (Orland) with particular knowledge of the genre. We document this iterative process as a case study for similar interdisciplinary projects. Our findings also highlight the current capabilities and limitations of using pattern discovery algorithms for musical analysis.
